# there are two types of typecasting are there 1 - explicit 2 - implicit
# Explicit - the conversion of one deta type into other data type ,done by user or manually as per the requirement 
# Implicit - the conversion that python doing by itself by its interpriter, pyhton implicit a samller data type into a higher datatype to prevent data lose
